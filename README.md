Amd global modules
==========================

This script changes behavior of AMD javascript loaders (requirejs): all required modules will be exported to global object ( *window* in browser environment).

May be useful for debugging purposes (access all objects exported by modules via browser console).

This script is distributed as AMD module in Bower package.
